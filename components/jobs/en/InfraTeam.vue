  <p>At <strong>InfraTeam</strong>, I was responsible for designing and developing the website for <strong>InfraDays</strong> â€“ an innovative event combining an expo and a multi-conference focused on engineering and technologies used in the design, construction, and maintenance of linear infrastructure. As part of the project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I created a modern, responsive user interface using <strong>Vue.js</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and later <strong>Quasar</strong>, ensuring an intuitive and high-performance application.</li>
    <li>I optimized website performance and loading times, allowing the platform to run smoothly even under high traffic conditions.</li>
  </ul>
